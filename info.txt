The watcher executable takes config.ini file as input.
Config file contains the directory path. 

read_config() ==> read config file and set the directory path in g_directories_to_monitor variable.
monitor_directory() ==> It used inotity system library and monitor the directory and capture the interrupt.

CLogger class ==> It allows only one object to be initailized using singelton desing pattern and write function will allow to write in history.log file


Future Implementation:
1. Multiple files can be monitored using select and queue.
2. Thread based implementation shall be done where 
	one thread monitor file and 
	another will read config file in another thread
3. DEBUG TRACING shall be added. 
4. File shall be created on day basis.
